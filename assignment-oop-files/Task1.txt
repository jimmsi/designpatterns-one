What happens if the designers of the Storage class decide to change the implementation
of the List to LinkedList?

The trimToSize function will no longer work because LinkedList does not have this method.
You will also need to update all instances in the Storage class where variables of
type ArrayList are created. Additionally, ensure that only LinkedList objects are
saved to the file.

Think about the method calls in main - does trimToSize() exist in LinkedList?

No.

Should Main know about what concrete type of List Storage provides?

No, this is not necessary, actually it's not recommended.
